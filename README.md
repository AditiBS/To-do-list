## 🎉 What feature did you enjoy building the most?

I enjoyed building the **"Mark as Completed"** feature the most. It was fun to figure out how to strike through the task when it’s done and change its appearance with CSS and JavaScript.

## 💡 What would you add next if you had more time?

If I had more time, I would add:
- Local storage, so tasks stay even after refreshing the page
